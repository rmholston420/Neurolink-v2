#
# Two-tier guard pattern:
#   Tier 1 (eeg_pump.py)  — len(ppg_buffer) < _MIN_PPG_SAMPLES: skip the
#       compute_ppg() call entirely.  Prevents neurokit2 from running on
#       a buffer that is too short to yield any peaks at all.
#   Tier 2 (here)         — len(ppg_arr) < _MIN_SAMPLES: same check inside
#       compute_ppg() for callers that bypass the pump guard (tests, etc.).
#
# Even with both guards in place, neurokit2.ppg_process() can return an
# empty peaks array on a full-length buffer of low-quality signal (weak
# electrode contact, motion artefacts during the settling window).  When
# that happens the IndexError / ValueError it raises is an expected,
# transient condition — not a bug.  It is caught below and logged at
# DEBUG rather than WARNING so it is invisible at the default info
# threshold.
